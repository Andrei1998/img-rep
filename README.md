# Image RePaint

Python script for image [inpainting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting) of dead pixels.
Supports multiple block based recovery modes:

* Arithmetic average of non-dead pixels 
* [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur#Mathematics) average of non-dead pixels
* WIP: [Orthogonal Matching Pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pursuit)

### Prerequisites

NumPy and PIL (i.e. Pillow) need to be installed in order for the script to work properly. Install them by running this command from the project directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example

Non-damaged image (data/img/dog1.jpg):

<img src="data/img/dog1.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="image could not load">

Blacken 70 percent of its pixels:

<img src="data/damaged_img_70/dog1.bmp" width="400" height="266" alt="image could not load">

Attempt to restore the image using Gaussian Averaging:

<img src="data/restored_img_predict_gauss_70/dog1.bmp" width="400" height="266" alt="image could not load">
